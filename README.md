# README for the pyRRTMG Python package

RRTMG_SW and RRTMG_LW are two-stream radiative transfer models widely
used in atmospheric models written in FORTRAN. For more information on
these two models, have a look at http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html.
pyRRTMG is a Python package for using these models from Python.

Installation of the package is based on the standard procedure using
`python setup.py install`. See the file INSTALl.md for more details.

Usage examples are given in the examples sub-directory of the
package. As documentation is currently limited (contributions
welcome!), please carefully study these examples.

A list of known BUGS is maintained in the file BUGS.md, please check
this file and let me know (via deneke@tropos.de) of any other problems
you find.
