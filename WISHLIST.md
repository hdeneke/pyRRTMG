contributions are greatly appreciated. Please let me know
(deneke@tropos.de) if you are interested in a specific feature, and in
particular if you would like to work on this.

## General
* Implement test suite

## Inputs
* A-Train-based input scheme to obtain a 2B-FLXHR-like product
* CLOUDNET input scheme to obtain a radiative fluxes/heating-rate product
* ICON input scheme for offline radiation computations

## Outputs
* common NetCDF/CF-Conventions-based output format
* enable single-band vs band-integrated calculations/output

## Aerosols
* implement OPAC-based scheme for aerosol optical properties

## Clouds
* implement Baum scheme for ice cloud optical properties

## Fortran
* enable full g-point calculations
* add 4-stream solver for higher accuracy

## Python Interface
* add Python functions for cloud/aerosol optical properties
* add Python functions for McICA
